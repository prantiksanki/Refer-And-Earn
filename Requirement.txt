Overview 
        Create a basic Refer & Earn feature using the MERN stack. After a user registers, they 
        should be able to enter a referral code. If the code is valid, the user will receive reward 
        coins (value stored in the database). 


Requirements 

1. User Registration 
        • Build a simple API to register a user. 
        • Generate a unique referral code for every new user. 
        • Store user details in MongoDB (name, email, password, referral code, coins). 

2. Apply Referral Code 
        • Create an API where a user can submit a referral code after registration. 
        • Check: 
            o The referral code exists. 
            o User is not using their own code. 

3. Reward Coins 
        • Get the reward coin amount from a config collection in MongoDB. 
        • If the referral code is valid: 
            o Add reward coins to the user's account. 

4. Database 
        Use simple collections: 
            • users 
            • config (store reward coin value) 

5. Error Responses 
        Handle basic errors like: 
            • Invalid referral code 
            • Own referral code 



Deliverables 
        • Two working APIs: 
                o POST /register 
                o POST /apply-referral 
        • Mongoose models for users and config. 
        • UI for registration and apply Refer code
